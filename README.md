# Classification of Financial Complaints and LLM-Based Summarization

For this project I've gathered customer complaints taken from the US Consumer Complaints Database. The original dataset has the written complaints, a product label and 20 other features. 
Here I use only the `'issued label'` and the text of the `'complaint'`. Keeping the label will enable us to validate how well the zero-shot classifier has done the job.
